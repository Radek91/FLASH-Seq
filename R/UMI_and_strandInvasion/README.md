## Main analysis

1. **1_strand_invasion.Rmd**: Explore UMI invasion events.

2. **2_TSO-UMI_analysis.Rmd**: Properties of UMI reads (counts, read distribution, ...).

3. **oligonucleotide_frequency.R**: explore the frequency of spacer (w/ or w/o -GGG) in a genome / transcriptome.

4. **filterInvasionEventsfromBAM.R**: Filter out reads with a UMI matching with the sequence upstream of the mapping position.
